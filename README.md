# Home Assistant configuration

Rewritten more or less everything, focusing on less but smarter automations
where everything should have a known state regardless source of trigger.
Some of them ends up quite huge and complex.

Also using more helpers for better structure and easier handling of states and updates cross automations.

Configuration should be seen as is in a continues rolling update, some parts will have a different 
structure than the rest and older parts may or may not be updated accordingly

Got lots of ideas and inspiration from [Thomas Lov√©n](https://github.com/thomasloven) and [Frenck](https://github.com/frenck)
